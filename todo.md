# Crit — TODO

## Features (From Spec, Not Yet Implemented)

- [ ] **GitHub Actions release workflow**: Cross-compile binaries on tagged releases (spec has a workflow sketch).
- [ ] **Homebrew tap**: `brew install crit`.
- [ ] **Comment collapse/expand**: Comments can be collapsed/expanded (spec section "Displayed comments"). Currently all comments are always expanded.
- [ ] **Empty/binary file handling**: Show user-friendly messages for empty files or non-markdown files (spec "Edge Cases").
- [ ] **Very large files**: Test with files up to ~10k lines, ensure no performance issues.

## UI Refinements

- [ ] **Mobile/responsive**: Basic responsive CSS exists but untested on small screens.
