# Crit - Plan Review Workflow

Before implementing any non-trivial feature, write an implementation plan as a markdown file.

## Writing plans

When asked to implement a feature, first create a plan file that covers:
- What will be built
- Which files will be created or modified
- Key design decisions and trade-offs
- Step-by-step implementation order

## Review with Crit

After writing the plan, start crit in the background and wait for the review:

```bash
crit $PLAN_FILE --no-open --port 3001 & crit wait 3001
```

This starts crit on port 3001, then blocks until the reviewer clicks Finish Review. The review prompt is printed to stdout automatically — no user interaction needed.

Do NOT begin implementation until `crit wait` exits (indicating the review is done).

## After review

Read the `.review.md` file to find inline comments marked with `> **[REVIEW COMMENT - Lines X-Y]**:`. Address each comment by revising the original plan file.

For subsequent rounds, signal completion and wait for the next review:

```bash
crit go --wait 3001
```

Only proceed with implementation after the user approves the final plan.
